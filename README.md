YouTube Analysis is a data analysis project that leverages Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, and others. The project involves analyzing YouTube video data from CSV and JSON files to extract insights and perform detailed analysis. Below is an overview of the analyses conducted in this project:

Project Overview:

1.Text Sentiment Analysis:

Sentiment analysis of comments was performed using the TextBlob library.
Word clouds were generated to visualize positive and negative comments.
These word clouds were displayed as images using matplotlib.

2.Emoji Analysis:

Emojis used in the comment_text field were analyzed using the emoji library.
A bar graph was plotted to depict the relationship between emojis and their frequency.

3.Comprehensive YouTube Data Analysis:

All JSON and CSV files related to YouTube data were imported.
CSV files were merged into a single dataframe for unified analysis.

4.Category-Wise Maximum Likes:

Analyzed which categories received the highest likes.
A box plot was used for graphical representation.

5.Audience Engagement Analysis:

Metrics such as like rate, dislike rate, and comment count rate were analyzed to evaluate audience engagement.
These insights were visualized using box plots.

6.Likes vs. Dislikes Analysis:

The relationship between likes and dislikes was analyzed using a regression plot.

7.Correlation Heatmap:

A heatmap was created to identify correlations between views, likes, and dislikes.

8.Channel with the Most Trending Videos:
